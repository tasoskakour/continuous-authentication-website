### Description
A website to collect keystrokes and to apply the [continuous-authentication-service](https://github.com/tasoskakour/continuous-authentication-service)

#### Procedure of service
- You `create an account`
- You perform the use case scenarios in order for the service to collect as many `keystrokes`
- The admin of the service `trains` the system and then a `keystroke profile` is created for you
- Every time you log-in and after that each N seconds, your keystrokes are collected and analyzed on server for `anomalies`. If anomalies are detected you are given a confirmation-test to prove that you are who you say you are.
